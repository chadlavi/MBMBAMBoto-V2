This is a reddit bot which will fetch links to episodes of the [My Brother, My Brother and Me](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me) podcast. By listening and parsing comments on the [/r/mbmbam](http://mbmbam.reddit.com) subreddit, it will comment a link to a requested episode. The bot listens to each comment, attempting to match the regular expression "\!\d+". For each match, it uses the digit string to connect to the associated episode based on the shows rss feed.   
**EXAMPLE**  
Say someone comments "!100". The bot matches "!100" with the regular expression, and gets the episode link for episode 100. It then processes this link into a string to comment.
